// each node has a max of 2 child nodes
// the left child node is less than the parent node. The right child node is more than the parent node. 
// Because of the principle of a binary search the average operation is going to skip about half the tree. So, each, seach, add or deletion takes O(log(n)). 

// here I'm going to use classes to create a binary search tree.
