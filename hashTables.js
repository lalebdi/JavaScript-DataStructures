// is used to implment associative arrays or mappings of key-value pairs.
// they are common to implment a common map data structure or objects. 
// they are commonly used because they are efficient. The average time complexity is O(1) and the worst case is O(n). 
// it takes a key input and runs it in a hash function. 
//  a hash function maps strings to numbers. The numbers correspond to indexes of an array. It should map different strings to different numbers. 
// if two strings get hashed to the same number, a collision occures. One way of handling a collsions is by storing both values in the same number, then iterated through that number to get the value from the number. this could be slow. 
// Hash tables are built in JavaScript, which are used to implement objects.
